Next Pathway’s products solve the biggest challenges customers face when moving legacy workloads to the cloud.  Our cloud migration product, SHIFT Cloud, simplifies and accelerates the migration of Enterprise Data Warehouses, Data Lakes and Data Pipelines to leading cloud targets by automating the translation of complex legacy code and ETL pipelines to cloud native targets.   

Our cloud migration planning product, CRAWLER360 scans through every object contained in legacy systems to visualize ETL pipelines across multiple data warehouses and data lakes.  CRAWLER360 allows users to dynamically create cloud migration wave plans and immediately trigger code translation (using SHIFT) and generate test scripts.

Next Pathway has 7 patents in automation - including the ability to automatically translate code from one language to another, translate legacy ETL pipelines to cloud-native languages, automatically create cloud-based data models and automatically build cloud-based microservices.

Next Pathway has offices in Toronto, New York, and Pune.  On August 4, 2022, Next Pathway and Microsoft announced a collaboration to accelerate the migration from legacy data warehouses and data lakes to Microsoft Azure. In addition, in 2022, SHIFT was shortlisted as the Best Cloud Automation Solution by The Cloud Awards.  Our President, and co-founder, Clara Angotti, was selected to DiversityFirst’s 2021 list of the Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Technology and in 2021 Next Pathway won the Best in Business Award.
