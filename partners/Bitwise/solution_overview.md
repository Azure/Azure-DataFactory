**Bitwise Automated ETL Conversion Solution**

For organizations modernizing data and analytics on Azure, one of the most challenging aspects of migrating your traditional data warehouse to a cloud data lake architecture is converting your on-premise ETL jobs to Azure Data Factory (ADF). Many organizations attempt to convert the ETL code manually, but due to ETL complexity manual conversion typically takes longer than expected which can delay or even derail a migration initiative.


When migrating any on-premise ETL to ADF, having a clear, up-front time and cost estimate is key to gaining stakeholder buy-in, minimizing risk and achieving defined milestones to accelerate time-to-market. Bitwise, a Microsoft Gold Partner, helps accelerate such initiatives by solving the most challenging part of migrating your on-premise ETL jobs to ADF using automated conversion.
