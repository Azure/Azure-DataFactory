Delphixâ€™s Continuous Compliance solution enables data compliance and security, unlocking data within Azure Data Factory (ADF) data flows to accelerate digital transformation initiatives. Delphix automatically finds and masks sensitive data for compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA, while mitigating risk of data theft.

Data masking replaces sensitive data values with fictitious, yet realistic data
while preserving referential integrity. Masked data from Delphix retains its business value for Data Factory Pipeline runs used in testing, analytics, and AI/ML programs.

With pre-packaged accelerators for systems including SAP and SalesForce, Delphix makes it easy to bring compliance to the most challenging ETL/ELT workloads, such as moving application data to Azure Synapse Analytics, Data Lake, or Databricks. Key features include:

- Fast, fully-automated sensitive data discovery and masking with predefined or custom algorithms
- Simple, code-free approach to implementing compliance and security policies
- Pre-packaged masking accelerators for enterprise applications including SAP and Salesforce
