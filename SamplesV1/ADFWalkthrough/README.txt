This sample provides an end-to-end walkthrough of a canonical scenario of log processing using Azure Data Factory to transform data from log files into insights.

Scenario
Contoso is a gaming company that creates games for multiple platforms: game consoles, hand held devices, and personal computers (PCs). Each of these games produces tons of logs. Contoso’s goal is to collect and analyze the logs produced by these games to get usage information, identify up-sell and cross-sell opportunities, develop new compelling features etc. to improve business and provide better experience to customers.

In this walkthrough, we will collect sample logs, process and enrich them with reference data, and transform the data to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign that Contoso has recently launched.
